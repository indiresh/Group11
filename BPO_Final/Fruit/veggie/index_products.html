 <tr>
 <td rowspan="2"><div><img src="images/Big Pickle Pics/gala apples.jpg" alt="" /></div></td>
 <td>Organic Gala Apples</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>

 <td>The Gala Apple is a cross between the Kidd's Orange Red and the Golden Delicious. Most Gala apples are yellow-gold with pink to red stripes, while some Gala strains may be nearly solid red. Now these wonderfully delicious apples that everyone has grown up loving are organic.</td>
 </tr>
 </table> 

<table border="1", rowspan="2">
 <tr>
 <td rowspan="2"><div><img src="images/Big Pickle Pics/blood orange.jpg" alt="" /></div></td>
 <td> Organic Blood Oranges</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>

 <td>Organic Blood Oranges are in abundant supply December through the month of March. Named for their deep pink or red-streaked flesh, these Blood Oranges are sweetly flavored. Their skins may have a reddish blush. Smaller than an average orange with slightly rougher skin.</td>
 </tr>
 </table>


<table border="1", rowspan="2">
 <tr>
 <td rowspan="2"><div><img src="images/Big Pickle Pics/bing cherry.jpg" alt="" /></div></td>
 <td> Organic Bing Cherries</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>

 <td>Organic Bing Cherries make a wonderful snack, anytime. Bing Cherries are distinguished by their beautiful deep ruby skin and flesh. Bing Cherries are soft to the touch and very plump and juicy, perfect for a summer treat.</td>
 </tr>

 <table border="1", rowspan="2">
 <tr>
 <td rowspan="2"><div><img src="images/Big Pickle Pics/cocktail grapefruit.jpg" alt="" /></div></td>
 <td>Organic Cocktail Grapefruits</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>

 <td>Organic Cocktail Grapefruits are exceptionally sweet and juicy. They are not actually a true grapefruit, but a cross between a Frua Mandarin and a Pummelo. This variety has a similar flavor to a grapefruit but is sweeter and less acidic.</td>
 </tr>
 </table>
 
  <table border="1", rowspan="2">
 <tr>
 <td rowspan="2"><div><img src="images/Big Pickle Pics/black grape.jpg" alt="" /></div></td>
 <td>Organic Black Seedless Grapes</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>

 <td>Organic Black Seedless Grapes are grown in a micro-climate vineyard in Traverse City Michigan. Of course grapes deliver great health benefits; they are a good source of dietary fiber and are naturally fat-free. These Organic Black Seedless Grapes are even better because they are specifically designed to produce a better-tasting and larger-sized grape than their conventional counterparts.</td>
 </tr>
 </table>
 
   <table border="1", rowspan="2">
 <tr>
 <td rowspan="2"><div><img src="images/Big Pickle Pics/blackberries.jpg" alt="" /></div></td>
 <td>Organic Blackberries</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>

 <td>Organic Blackberries taste best when they are very dark purplish-black to completely black. These berries are rich in antioxidants, especially in vitamin C. These berries have a tart-sweet flavor and can easily be consumed as a wonderfully plump and juicy snack.</td>
 </tr>
 </table>

   <table border="1", rowspan="2">
 <tr>
 <td rowspan="2"><div><img src="images/Big Pickle Pics/canary melon.jpg" alt="" /></div></td>
 <td>Organic Canary Melons</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>

 <td>Canary Melons vary in shape from oval to oblong, almost similar to a bright yellow Honeydew Melon. The pale green to cream-colored skin protects the juicy pale orange flesh. Its firm, crisp flesh offers a very distinctive delicately sweet flavor, which unlike its appearance tastes more like a Cantaloupe.</td>
 </tr>
 </table>


   <table border="1", rowspan="2">
 <tr>
 <td rowspan="2"><div><img src="images/Big Pickle Pics/plumcoat.jpg" alt="" /></div></td>
 <td>Organic Dapple Dandy Plumcots</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>

 <td>The Organic Dapple Dandy Plumcot looks very much like a small, red dinosaur egg because of its artfully speckled appearance. Their thin-skin is a vibrant pinkish color freckled with maroon spots. The inside is even more precious because the rich, red flesh tastes like a combination of plum and apricot.</td>
